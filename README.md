Made the backend to a ecommerce website used node.js a working express api incorperated sequalize to connect to a created mysql database. Dependencies where express,mysql,dontev and sequalize. Used const commands and path links to import sequalize .Did app.get commands to define routes for the root path, app.use commands for using the api routes. Used sequalize.sync commands to sync sequalize models to the database. Created a database in mysql that was just synced with sequalize. After this i was able to start my server after connecting routes with the neccesary files. I configured requests to perform specific requests to the server using insomnia and recorded using screencastify.
